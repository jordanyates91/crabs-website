# React Component Standards

1. Component Organization:
   - Each component should be in its own file
   - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `Header.jsx`)
   - Co-locate component styles in a matching `.css` file (e.g., `Header.css`)

2. Component Structure:
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Props should be destructured in the function parameters
   - Keep components focused and single-purpose
   - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

3. Component Exports:
   - Use named exports for components
   - Export components as default only if they are the main component in the file

4. Importing Components:
   - When importing into a file, always verify that the component you are importing exists at the location you are attempting to import from. 

Example component structure:
```jsx
import './ComponentName.css';

export function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {
  // Component logic here
  return (
    <div className="component-name">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
